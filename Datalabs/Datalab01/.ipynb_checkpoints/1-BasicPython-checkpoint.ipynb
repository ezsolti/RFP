    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is general-purpose, high-level interpreted programming language. One of the main goals when designing the language was to make it easy to read and to write. Indeed, often writing a python code feels like writing pseudo-code (ie. using plain language to describe an algorithm). Since it is interpreted, the instructions are directly executed by the python interpreter, and users do not need to bother with compiling the code. Besides, python is freely usable and distributable. These make the code ideal for any introductory programming course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two main versions, which coexisted in the recent years and have some differences: Python2 and Python3. In my opinion any novice user should only learn Python3 (you are welcome to search for debate articles), thus in this course we use Python3 interpreters and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning a programming language at depth takes lot of time, espescially if it is your first programming language. It takes a lot of practice and dedication. This introduction is just a guidance to help you achieve your goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This datalab reviews\n",
    "- how to run your python code\n",
    "- how to create variables\n",
    "- the different data types\n",
    "- loops and conditions\n",
    "- definition of functions\n",
    "- how to read files\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the tutorial you will know the basic python syntax to manage the implementation of simple algorithms and mathematics on your own. Before running each of the code blocks, think what would you expect as an output, and compare the result with your expectation. If you get curious about some functionality, try to come up with small experiments to see how Python works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to cover most of the things what is needed for this course, however no one is expected to know every built-in functions and perks of python, so you will often search the web for answers. There are so many good tutorials ([like this one](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)) and forum entries, that I do not even try to list them. It is also an important skill for you to find them yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the language in itself is just a tool, we as users also need to follow the Zen of Python if we would like to write great code (you can execute the cell below with the \"Run\" button, or with Shift+Enter)"

During this course we will rely on some of them:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Jupyter notebooks to run code, however it is useful if you know how to run python code without Jupyter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is an interpreted language it can be executed line by line, which allows to use it in an interactive way. To execute it you can use the python interpreter or a jupyter notebook interactivaly, or you can place your script in a file, and execute that. During this course however we will mostly rely on jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing python on your computer you can type `python`in your terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt (Windows) to initiate the Python interpreter. You will see a command prompt starting with >>>. Then you can type commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    >>> 299792458*299792458\n",

    "    2.76\n",

    "This is convenient to use the language as a calculator or to test smaller code snippets. You can exit the interpreter by typing `exit()` or `quit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook (such as this one) is an interactive terminal what you can open in a browser window, and allows you to mix documents (written in Markdown language and/or latex) with executable code and plots. It is very convenient if one wants to demonstrate something or provide some data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can type `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to launch a notebook environment, and then write the code and the document. Also [Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides a way to create jupyter notebooks in the cloud. When using Colab, one does not need to install anything, since it offers the most often used packages readily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script from file\n",
    "\n",
    "If one needs to write a longer script or program, it is often more convinient to save it into a file, and execute it. Let's consider you have written a script in *file.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   myNumber=4\n",
    "   print('My square is: ',myNumber*myNumber)\n",

    "```\n",
    "   $ python file.py \n",
    "   My square is:  16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For even longer projects, which might be separated into several files it is often useful to create *module*s or *package*s, which we will touch upon briefly, however within this course will not need to worry about the creation of such."

Actually there are more ways to of [string formatting](https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/), here at most places we used one widespread method, by using spaceholders for the variable's content to be included: `%.nx`, where *.n* gives the number of floating points to be printed, and *x* clarifies the type of the variable (*d* for integers or decimals, *f* for floating point numbers, *e* for scientific notation, and *s* for string). This is similar as some other languages work, however not necessarily the most pythonic solution. But you can see an example for using the more pythonic `.format()` method also.\n",

Here you can also notice that $x=x+2$ seems incorrect according to math, however in program languages it is common: the left hand side access the current value of the variable, then adds 2, and assigns the result to the variable. **Note**: the precedence of the operators is important (first exponentation, then division, multiplication, addition/substraction is performed, so one can use brackets `()` to change the precedence)\n"

    "Often a certain sequence of statements we need to execute repeatedly. In order to avoid copying code we can organize certain parts into functions (copying is both ugly and error-prone). This also allows our code to be reusable. Functions take parameters which need to be listed at the definition, and optionally they can `return` variables. These parameters have a local scope (they don't exist outside the function). If a variable used by the function is neither listed as an input parameter nor defined within the function, python will look for the variable in the global namespace. Sometimes such behaviour is intentional, but one needs to be careful, using the same variable names locally and globally can lead to bugs. (You can further read on *namespace* and *scope* [here](https://realpython.com/python-namespaces-scope/)).  It is however possible to write a function without any parameters or returns. For example:"

There are of course several good ways to write data (by structuring it according to some standard; we will learn about this in the next datalab), but it often happens that a file contains content for which you need to write a parser to extract the relevant information. This is espescially true for the outputfiles generated by some old, legacy scientific softwares.\n",

We can see that this function will create an object of the `_io.TextIOWrapper` class (we talk about classes a bit more in a following datalab).
