    "In this notebook, we will try to get a hands-on feeling for how the neutron density in a reactor can change with time, given a certain change in reactivity. As you saw in the lecture, this behaviour may to first order be described by the point kinetics equation. We will first look at the most basic assumption about neutron generation in a reactor, assuming that all neutrons are produced _at the moment of fission_. These are the prompt neutrons. After that, we will study the infuence of a small but very important portion of the neutron population: the delayed neutrons. To describe the time dependence of the neutron density, we'll need to use differential equations. In the lecture, we have looked at analytical solutions to these, and in this notebook, we will opt for two different numerical approaches: using a numerical solver implemented in Python and using Monte Carlo methods. Both of these methods are used in many real-life applications when it is impossible to find an analytic solution and/or the system becomes more complex. Thereore, these are skills that are applicable not only in reactor physics, but also in a broader context within science and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of the notebook, we will look at the inhour equation, which was studied during the lecture. The inhour equation tells us something about the time dependence of the neutron density (or reactor power) as a function of the reactivity change. In particular, it tells us the time constants involved in the neutron density change. To find those from the inhour equation, we will use numerical tools for root finding. Also this is a technique which is very useful in a wide range of applications.\n",

    "### Reactor with only prompt neutrons\n",
    "Let's start with the most basic case. We assume that the reactor is critical (i. e. $k = 1$, $\\rho = 0$), and that all neutrons used to sustain the chain reaction are prompt. Each neutron will \"live\" on average a time $l$ between its generation and ultimate absorption. For a thermal reactor, $l \\simeq 10^{-4}$ s, and for a fast reactor, $l \\simeq 10^{-7}$ s. As shown during the lecture, setting up the neutron diffusion under these conditions yields an expression for the rate of thange in the neutron density $n$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\left ( \\frac{k-1}{l} \\right ) n(t)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what does this differential equation tell us? It tells us that the rate of change depends on how many neutrons there are presently, and on the time constant $(k-1)/l$. The time constant tells us at what rate change in $n$ will occur, _given the current value of $n$_. In fact, the probability for a neutron to be added or removed from the system within a short time $\\Delta t$ is given by:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Prob(\\Delta t) = \\Delta t\\left | \\frac{k-1}{l} \\right |\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability is independent of $n$, but the _total_ rate of change will depend on $n$. We are now interested in describing how $n$ actually depends on the time $t$, so we must solve this differential equation. First, we will do this using a Monte Carlo approach, which gives a rather intuitive feeling for what is going on. Consider a reactor with a neutron density $n(0)$ at time $t = 0$, where $k$ is now increased or decreased (away from 1). The value of $k$ will determine whether we are considering an increasing or decreasing neutron density. The neutron density _after_ $\\Delta t$ (that is, at time step $i+1$) is now given by:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta n}{\\Delta t} = \\left ( \\frac{k-1}{l} \\right ) n_i \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\Delta n}{n_i} = \\left ( \\frac{k-1}{l} \\right )\\Delta t,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where you may recognise our probability on the right hand side. Although we could in principle sample the decay/production probability for each neutron in the system, this could lead to numerical problems (if the population grows exponentially). Therefore, we will start by using Monte Carlo methods to sample the right hand side of the above equation. This describes the _fractional_ increase in the neutron population, so in our solution we will study the neutron population _relative to the population at time $t = 0$_. Nonetheless, because we use Monte Carlo methods to sample the probability distribution above, there will be statistical fluctuations depending on how many samples we use to estimate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experiment 1: Prompt neutron kinetics using Monte Carlo\n",
    "First, we want to use Monte Carlo to model the change in neutron population. The idea of this task is that you should see the effect of changing the $k$ value, as well as the statistical properties of the Monte Carlo approach.\n",
