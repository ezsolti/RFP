    "During this datalab we will investigate how the fuel composition changes during the reactor operation. For this we will use openmc's `deplete` module. OpenMC solves the transport problem with a Monte Carlo approach to obtain reaction rates, and then the Batemen-equations are solved with these reaction rates. Nevertheless, the coupling between the depletion and the transport calculation is not a trivial task, there are various coupling schemes to achieve that. Within this datalab we do not look into the depth of various coupling techniques, and we will just use the most default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve an accurate depletion study one needs to have as many time steps when the depletion equations are solved as possible, and due to this, burnup calculations are time consuming, espescially when the reaction rates are based on Monte Carlo transport solvers. During this datalab we will focus on the phenomena and on qualitative results, therefore we will not care about accuracy. That said we will use only few particles per batch, and very long depletion steps. We will also neglect downtime periods (when the reactor is not operating).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab is going to have two experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will use our good old PWR pincell model to investigate how the neutron spectrum, the k-eigenvalue and the nuclide concentrations change over time\n",
    "2. We will build a graphite moderated, natural uranium fuelled reactor's pincell model to estimate the Plutonium production. This is already part of your last set of home assignments, so don't feel stressed to finish it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will define the same PWR pincell model as in the previous datalabs. The only newly added feature here is that we set the `volume` attribute for the object `uo2`. This is necessary for burnup calculations. Since we have an axially infinite pin, we only gave the cross sectional area of the pin. In the latest version of openMC the `deplete.Operator` requires a `Model` object as an input, therefore add the geometry, materials, settings and tallies to a `Model()`. (If, for any reason, you are using an older version, we kept the related lines commented out, and you can switch to that.)\n",
