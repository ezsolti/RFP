    "We have previously seen how to handle the neutron transport problem with Monte Carlo methods. However, Monte Carlo particle transport does have a very significant flaw: it is time consuming. In practical, industrial applications neutron transport it solved with deterministic methods, and Monte Carlo is usually used as a validational method (although as the computers are becoming more powerful, the role of Monte Carlo calculations is getting even more significant). \n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic neutron transport has many parts (from handling slowing down and thermalization to get group constants till performing full core neutron diffusion calculation), and it is outside of the scope of this course. Nevertheless, during this datalab we will look at the basic idea of solving neutron diffusion with numerical methods. For this we will limit ourselves to a very simple case: we will assume that our reactor is a 1-dimensional slab, where all the neutrons are traveling with the same speed (ie. one-group theory), and we will also not bother much with boundary conditions. The intention of the lab is to provide an impression of the deterministic solutions, and not to get lost in details (for readers who would like to go in depth, we can recommend the [Duderstadt & Hamilton book](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/89079) as a starter, and then the [Computational Nuclear Engineering book of McClarren](https://www.elsevier.com/books/computational-nuclear-engineering-and-radiological-science-using-python/mcclarren/978-0-12-812253-2), and finally for the brave the [Applied Reactor Physics book of Hébert](https://www.polymtl.ca/merlin/downloads/5784_depliant-AppliedReactor_ep3.pdf)). \n",
